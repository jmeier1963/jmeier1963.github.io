  reintroduction of the Mexico City Policy has the potential to hold back
  progress on increasing access to modern contraception, increasing the number
  of unintended pregnancies and actually making unsafe abortion more common.
  Its impact falls hardest on women in sub-Saharan Africa, who are most reliant
  on US supported services.</p>
  <p>Since
  December 2016 CIFF has worked with like-minded organisations through
  <a href=""http://www.shedecides.com"">SheDecides</a> to sustain funding for vital sexual and reproductive health

  <p>Marie
  Stopes International (MSI) is among the most severely impacted. Particularly
  affected are their outreach services – mobile units that reach the poorest
  women and girls with contraceptive services. Around half of all MSI’s family
  planning services are delivered by outreach teams. Globally, the funding cuts
  will mean that MSI reaches fewer women, delivers less services, with
  far-reaching consequences for women’s health – potentially 6.5 million
  unintended pregnancies and over two million unsafe abortions that would
  otherwise have been prevented.</p>
  <p>This
  investment of $10 million is designed to ensure continuity of services,
  particularly their outreach teams that reach the poorest women. This will
  partially address MSI’s shortfall of $31 million each year as a consequence
  of funding cuts. It will help prevent the closure of outreach services that
  serve the poorest and hardest-to-reach. </p>

  Stopes International (MSI) is among the most severely impacted. Particularly
  affected are their outreach services – mobile units that reach the poorest
  women and girls with contraceptive services. Around half of all MSI’s family
  planning services are delivered by outreach teams. Globally, the funding cuts
  will mean that MSI reaches fewer women, delivers less services, with
  far-reaching consequences for women’s health – potentially 6.5 million
  unintended pregnancies and over two million unsafe abortions that would
  otherwise have been prevented.</p>
  <p>This
  investment of $10 million is designed to ensure continuity of services,

  partially address MSI’s shortfall of $31 million each year as a consequence
  of funding cuts. It will help prevent the closure of outreach services that
