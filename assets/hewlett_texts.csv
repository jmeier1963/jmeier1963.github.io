358,"The Advisory Finance Group (AFG) is a project to provide technical support to a group of central banks, finance ministers, and development finance institutions to integrate climate concerns into fiscal and monetary policy. AFG presupposes that most climate risk will eventually be borne by sovereign governments. Traditional climate advocacy has sought to ameliorate this risk through fiscal (carbon pricing, etc.) and regulatory means. The continuing failure of nation states to enact fiscal climate solutions (to say nothing of the gridlock around fiscal solutions to the 2008 financial crisis) has lead the AFG to propose the development of central bank/monetary-driven risk-based approaches. The theory posits that quantifying and assigning risks to public and large private asset classes would be analogous to carbon pricing mechanisms. In addition, policy success might be easier to achieve at the central bank level rather than through legislative bodies. One key element would be the creation of new AI tools to replace the equilibrium-based tools currently in use to quantify and assign risk.  For The Advisory Finance Group"

972,"The goal of this proposal is to research the efficacy of scaling Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in key states as well create the analytical framework to allow policy makers to determine if increased federal support for CCS research, development and deployment is warranted. CCS is an important component of most climate models - including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and International Energy Agency - if a two degree goal is to be met. CCS is happening currently at a small scale mostly around ethanol, chemicals and natural gas processing. Eight organizations are collaborating with the Institute at the state and federal level to create CCS ""Hubs"" in key states in an effort to get a critical mass of projects moving in order to reduce the cost of emission capture and sequestration. At the federal level, they are working with the Department of Energy (DOE) to create the case for incentives to use CO2 from industrial and power generation emissions instead of CO2 that is mined from the ground to increase the productivity of existing oil wells via Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR.) Establishing cost competitive CCS will be vital in India and China.  For Carbon Capture And Storage: A U.S. Strategy To Support Deployment"
